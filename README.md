# jquery.moreContent.js
Your client has too much content for his website and the content seems not that important (like a product description)? Say goodbye to long description content with this tiny plugin for jQuery. Oh, and hey: it's **SEO friendly** for all those who asked.

## How it works
If you implement **jquery.moreContent.js** correctly and call it on your prefered element the following will happen:

1. The element gets wrapped by a default wrapper with the class of ```mc-wrapper```
2. Button gets placed after your prefered element
3. Prefered element gets a default height or your defined height and an ```overflow: hidden;```
3. Some other weird sh*t happens

The result: the content only isn't viewable for the human eye, but Crawler doesn't have the ability to understand JavaScript, so they'll see the whole content without height limitation.

## Implementation
1. You'll need [jQuery](http://jquery.com/download/) and [Velocity.js](http://julian.com/research/velocity/)
2. Get [jquery.moreContent.js](../master/jquery.morecontent.js) up on your server
3. Copy and paste this in your HTML/PHP document```<script src="YOUR-JSDIR/jquery.moreContent.js"></scrip>```

That's it.

## Configuration
Like all cool plugins for jQuery, you can configure amazing stuff. Here's a short table of what's configurable with **jQuery.moreContent.js**:

parameter | type | data-attribute | default | description
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
height | int | ```data-height="160"``` | ```160``` | set height for element
duration | int | ```data-duration="1000"``` | ```1000``` | set duration for animation
btn | str | ```data-btn="Open"``` | ```"Open"``` | set default btn text
btnActive | str | ```data-btn-active="Close"``` | ```"Close"``` | set active btn text
btnClass | str | ```data-btn-class="btn-default"``` | ```"btn-default"``` | change btn class
